        <!-- second question and answer -->
        <div class="container">
            <h1 class="text-success text-center mt-5">Difference between Global scope and Block scope</h1>
            <div class="text-white">
                <p><strong>Global scope:</strong> A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared
                    outside all functions or curly
                    braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code
                    in the program, including inside blocks.</p>

                <p><strong>Block scope:</strong> So far, we've seen variables defined with the var keyword. Var can
                    declare a variable either in the global or local scope. The variables that are declared within the
                    block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center"><strong>ES6</strong> introduced block scope by using the let and const keywords.
                    These two keywords are scoped within the block which are defined.</p>

        <!-- third question and answer -->
        <div class="container text-white">
            <h1 class="text-success text-center mt-5">How to work event loop JavaScript ?</h1>
            <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
                is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
